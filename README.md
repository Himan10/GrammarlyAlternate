# What's this repo. for? 

Basically, ***[Grammarly](https://www.grammarly.com)*** is like your english teacher or a friend that suggests if there's any error, mispelled word or incorrect sentences. It can even help you to find out meanings of words or phrases.  

I've been using their add-on since 2019, and it has helped me a lot even since. Recently, I was using one of its features that pops up meaning of a word/phrase, and I found it little fascinating, honeslty speaking, so I found it very simple. I decided to give it a try, and this repo. is built specially for that purpose.
